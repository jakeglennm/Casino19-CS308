Created 9/23/2020

Must be connected to vpn
Url: coms-309-rp-10.cs.iastate.edu:8080
Where 8080 is the port SpringBoot is running on

Functionality will be give as .../*some request (type of request)
where ... is above url

Ex. coms-309-rp-10.cs.iastate.edu:8080/users

We currently as of 9/23 have a users table and games table, games is left unimplemented for now

Current User Funtionality (9/23)

	.../users (get)
	  this will return all objects in database as a json, an array of user objects
	  
	.../usernames (get)
	  returns string array where each string is of the form "id:username"
	  this is intended to be used to check if a user exists during login/signup process
	  mean to minimize the use of passwords moving back and forth, this is subject to change...
    
	.../user/{id} (get)
	  returns all attributes of the user with the given id
	  returns as json object
	
	.../user (post)
	  posting to /user will add a new user, the format will change based on current implementation
	  of SpringBoot app. A current example, pre demo 2 will be given below
	  {"username": "ateso", "password": "sk14", "email" : "athte.edu"}
	  shortly after demo 2 this will likely change, to show all new attributes
	  hopefull we will have ways to chage each aspect of a user with similar post requests
	  
	.../user/{id}
	  A delete mapping will remove the user of the id given in the request.
	  A message saying that user was removed will be sent back upon successful completion
	
	.../users/clearall
	  this command will delete all current users and data, this needs to be hidden eventually but may
	  prove to be useful as we test and add many fake users 
	  likeley to be removed, or saved for more privleged roles
